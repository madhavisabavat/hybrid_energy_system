# Hybrid Energy Storage System | Data Preprocessing & Simulation

This repository provides a **data preprocessing workflow and basic simulation framework** for a hybrid energy storage system, including:

- PEM electrolyzer
- Battery / Supercapacitor storage
- Renewable generation input (e.g., PV / wind)
- Scheduler for energy management (optional extension)

The project allows cleaning raw experimental/simulated data, performing feature engineering, and generating a processed dataset ready for machine learning or control system modeling.
